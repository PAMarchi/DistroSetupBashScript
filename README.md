It's a basic shell script to be used when setting up a new linux installation. It contains repositories updates, installation commands for basic software, as well as for more specific ones and some tweaks.

To run the .sh file run the command: "sudo chmod +x ./DistroSetupBashScript.sh" in order to give execution permission to the script, followed by the command: "sudo ./DistroSetupBashScript.sh".
